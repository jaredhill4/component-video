# Component - Video

This is a video component I developed and used on multiple client projects at White Lion Interactive.

## Functionality

The component consists of a thumbnail and a full-page video overlay. When clicked/tapped, the thumbnail triggers the video overlay, and creates an iframe element with the src set to the video URL based on the video id passed from a data attribute on the thumbnail. When closed, the overlay is hidden and the iframe element is destroyed.

_Note: This repo is for code review (read-only) purposes. The component relies on dependencies that are not not included in this project._
